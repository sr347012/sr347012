- 👋 Hi, I’m Sriram. I have been working on front end development. Earlier I worked on mainframes with exposure on AWS migration projects. I worked on twilio and made video conferencing using Angular. I created a face banking application which use AWS services like lex, polly and authenticate users based on facial recognition feature using openCV. Apart from these, I have always been a student of data science.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies and frameworks. I have exposure on HTML, CSS , JS, Angular. I would love to learn vue JS, React JS & WebGL(Three JS) in future. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to be a quick learner
- 💞️ I’m looking to work remotely for any front end developer positions
